# LifeHub

LifeHub is an all-in-one personal growth platform that unifies tasks, habits, goals, journaling, addiction tracking, and AI-powered reflection.  
A single place to manage your life, build discipline, and understand yourself through data and structure.

## 📌 Vision

Modern self-development tools are fragmented: one app for tasks, another for habits, another for mood or addiction tracking, and none of them understand the full picture.

**LifeHub aims to become a unified operating center for personal growth**, where all aspects of self-improvement work together:
- Tasks support goals  
- Habits build consistency  
- Reflection reveals patterns  
- AI helps analyze your state and progress  
- All data is connected

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- Provide a clean, unified interface for managing all areas of personal development.
- Help users build discipline and healthy habits.
- Make progress visible through analytics, history, and reflection.
- Assist with overcoming harmful behaviors and addictions.
- Use AI as a guide for journaling, insights, prompts, and pattern detection.
- Remove the need for multiple self-help apps.

## 📐 Architecture (draft)

LifeHub follows a modular design with clear domains:

- `Tasks`  
- `Habits`  
- `Journal`  
- `AddictionTracker`  
- `Goals`  
- `AI`  

Each module provides its own API layer, business logic, and database structures.  
AI is abstracted through a provider interface, allowing switching between local and cloud models.
